# min256-finder
An easy way to find the SHA-256 hash.
This tool allows you to find the SHA256 hashes of ISO files (and others) with just a few clicks. An .exe file has been generated using PyInstaller to make it easier to use on Windows systems. It does not require installation. Simply download the .exe file and run it by double-clicking. Tested on Windows 10.
